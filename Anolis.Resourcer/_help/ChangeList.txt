Anolis Resourcer Changelist
----------------------------

Release XXX - 201X-XX-XX

Issues fixed:
* Batch extraction now unloads ResourceSource files after processing, which frees up memory and should prevent Win32Exceptions from being thrown unnecessarily (see http://anolis.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=226755 ).

Improvements:
* When running on Windows Vista or Windows 7 with the Aero theme enabled, the toolbar now gets a much nicer background gradient that isn't as visually offensive as the Windows default. The gradient is the same as the one used in the Camifox theme for Firefox.

TODO:
* Embed UPX
* Redo Win32 ResourceSource to read PE file directly, and extract the resources that way (see PE/COFF specification), and so detect UPX and perform UPX first
* Fix up Dialog and Menu viewers, and get them to edit them too
* Unified string table editor
* Aero style Back/Up/Next buttons
